# How to Use BallotBox

Plain-English instructions for someone who has never used a blockchain. The longer
walkthrough, including running your own poll and acting as a trustee, is the

## What You Need

| | |
|---|---|
| A desktop Chrome-based browser | Chrome, Brave or Edge |
| A Midnight wallet | [Lace (Midnight)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-midnight-preview/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg) or [1AM](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/1am/bphnkdkcnfhompoegfpgnkidcjfbojjp) |
| Free test tokens | tNIGHT from the [Preprod faucet](https://faucet.preprod.midnight.network/) — no real money, ever |
| About 10 minutes | Only the first time. Voting later takes about a minute |

## Getting Started on Preprod

Preprod is Midnight's test network. Its tokens have no value, so nothing here can cost you
anything.

1. **Install the wallet** and create one. Write the recovery phrase down.
2. **Switch the wallet to Preprod** in its settings.
3. **Get tokens.** Copy your unshielded address (it starts `mn_addr_preprod1…`), paste it
   into the [faucet](https://faucet.preprod.midnight.network/), and request tNIGHT.
4. **Generate DUST.** DUST pays transaction fees and is generated from your tNIGHT. In the
   wallet, choose the DUST option and wait 3–5 minutes for the balance to appear.
5. **Choose a proof server.** Every action creates a zero-knowledge proof, and your wallet
   sends it somewhere to be proved. Either select a hosted prover in the wallet settings, or
   run one locally with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3 midnight-proof-server -v
   ```

   Then set the wallet's proof server to `http://localhost:6300`.

You are ready when the wallet shows **Preprod**, **synced**, and a DUST balance above zero.

## Your First Transaction

<img src="./screenshots/landing-mobile.png" alt="BallotBox on a phone: the featured poll with its question, turnout and a Connect wallet button" width="260" align="right">

The app is at **<https://private-pooling.vercel.app>**. On the home page, the featured poll
card shows the question, the stage and the turnout before you connect anything.

1. Open the poll link you were given, or the featured poll on the home page. You can read
   the question and see the turnout **before** connecting anything.
2. Press **Connect wallet & take part** and approve the connection.
3. Press **Join this poll**. Approve it in the wallet. This is your first transaction: it
   adds an anonymous commitment to the voter roll. It takes about 30–120 seconds, because
   your browser is building a zero-knowledge proof.
4. When the wallet asks, approve. When the card says you are enrolled, you are on the roll —
   and nobody, including the organizer, can tell which entry is yours.

## Step-by-Step Guide

**To vote**

1. Wait until the stage bar reads **Vote**.
2. Choose **Yes**, **No** or **Abstain**.
3. Approve the transaction. The card shows a timer while the proof is built.
4. *"Your encrypted ballot is recorded"* means it is counted.
5. Changed your mind? Vote again before voting closes — only your last ballot counts.

**To be counted as a tester (optional)**

- Press **Count me as a tester**. This adds your wallet to a public list that is kept
  separate from ballots, so it never reveals how you voted.

**To run your own poll**

1. Press **Deploy a new poll contract**. Your wallet becomes the admin.
2. Press 🔑 → **Download backup** and keep the file. Without it, clearing your browser
   means you can never run another poll on that contract.
3. Fill in **Start a new poll**: question, voting window in hours, quorum, and whether
   enrollment is open to anyone with the link.
4. Press **Become a trustee** — a poll needs at least one before voting opens. For a
   stronger guarantee, ask independent people to register too.
5. Press **Open voting** and share the invite link (📤).
6. When you are done, press **Close voting and begin decryption**. Each trustee submits a
   share, and then anyone can publish the result.

## What Gets Proved (and What Stays Private)

| You prove | Without revealing |
|---|---|
| You are on the voter roll | Which entry on the roll is yours |
| You have not already voted | Any link between your ballot and your earlier one |
| Your ballot is a valid choice | Which choice you made |
| The published counts match the encrypted ballots | Any individual ballot |

Your secret key and your vote never leave your browser. What reaches the chain is an
encrypted ballot, a one-time nullifier, and a proof. The full threat model, including what
someone watching your network connection can infer, is in [PRIVACY.md](../PRIVACY.md).

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| *"Your wallet cannot pay the fee"* | You need DUST. Get tNIGHT from the faucet, generate DUST, wait a few minutes |
| *"Could not reach the proof server"* | Start the Docker proof server, or pick a hosted prover in the wallet settings |
| *"Wallet is still syncing"* in the wallet popup | Wait until it says synced. Approving during a sync fails |
| *"You are not on this poll's voter roll yet"* | Press **Join this poll** first. On invite-only polls, send your commitment to the organizer |
| *"Your wallet did not respond"* | Unlock the wallet, confirm it is on Preprod, reload the page |
| Proving takes more than 3 minutes | Normal on a slow machine for a vote; the timer keeps counting. Do not close the tab |
| You cleared your browser and lost your role | Restore your key backup with 🔑. Without a backup, the old role cannot be recovered |
