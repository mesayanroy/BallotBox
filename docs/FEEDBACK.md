# BallotBox — User Feedback

## Overview

BallotBox was tested on Midnight Preprod by a cohort of **71 testers** between
**17 and 21 September 2026**. Each tester used the live app to try the private voting flow,
then sent in their wallet address, a rating out of 10 and a written review through the
BallotBox feedback form.

- **Feedback form:** <https://forms.gle/fhvKZZWAUh2z6kGj8>
- **Tester sheet (Google Sheet):** <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J-nT1Xgwcj4PxhvRjP3K-VFehBlQUnCMYxksyBgtWSk/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1893711454#gid=1893711454>

The tables in this document and in [USERS.md](../USERS.md) are taken from that tester sheet.

The testing covered:

- private voting and ballot submission
- finding, joining and following a poll
- wallet setup and connection
- transaction status and confirmation
- the poll lifecycle, from registration to published result
- tally verification
- onboarding and first-run guidance
- overall usability

This document records the ratings, the full written feedback, the themes that came up again
and again, and what changed in BallotBox as a result.

20 of the 71 reviews include a suggestion for improvement. All 9 testers who rated BallotBox
7 or lower (testers 1, 11, 12, 13, 28, 32, 35, 42 and 43) named a specific gap, and almost
every one of those gaps is about the **first run**: onboarding, wallet setup, or
understanding what is happening.

## What We Changed

The changes below are in the repository, and each one maps to a theme above. They landed on
21–22 September, at the end of the testing window. Several were already underway from the
pre-launch internal review, and the repository does not record which review prompted which
change. So each change is linked to the **theme** it addresses, not to an individual tester.

| Theme | Change in BallotBox | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| First-time onboarding | Landing page with a first-run checklist (install the wallet, fund it, join a poll) and an always-visible Feedback button | `e0dd8addad2e2e5fc8447373a9533c6807eb3d5f` |
| First-time onboarding, context for new users | Plain-English usage guide | `a5ff2e6bb1993ba297c9d375c6bbc48588452064` |
| Wallet setup guidance | Reworked masthead with a distinct state for each stage of the wallet connection | `cb3ed39cff5385302cc33c3e0520f91418f3fe1c` |
| Wallet setup, error messages | Raw wallet and SDK errors translated into messages that say how to fix the problem; product links centralised | `1a68cefe35a1ce3d7a31a8e5b71092745291edd8` |
| Transaction status and confirmation | Receipt after each successful transaction, with the transaction hash and block height | `ed2307412ae47945f2d4dd6ea8cc3c1a488135d6` |
| Explaining the poll lifecycle | Poll card split into one section per lifecycle stage, with a lifecycle stepper | `ebaf26bc65b49755dbd280bd89fc4f8251ab3e9a` |
| First-run reliability | Poll key kept in local storage, with backup and restore, so a page reload no longer loses a voter's eligibility | `7ec42ea2cc98611101dbff5da071c2bfe0a8734c` |
| Explaining privacy and verification | Deployment, privacy model and feedback-loop documentation | `7ef742ffb8fe89c82731090e2984c1d7802f48d9` |
| Feedback loop | Feedback log structured around themes and changes | `dd16e2ef89a37a1b83fb9b4ae94c3cf867a419fc` |

### Still open

The improvement themes are the checklist for the next round of testing:

- **Transaction waits.** Receipts confirm success, but testers 22 and 32 asked for clearer
  explanations of the wait itself, while the proof is generated and the transaction is
  submitted.
- **Explaining verification.** Tester 65 asked for a clearer explanation of verification.
  Tally verification exists (`npm run verify`), but the app does not yet explain it.
- **First run for users new to Midnight.** Re-test the checklist and usage guide with users
  who have never used a Midnight wallet (testers 8 and 55).
- **Follow-up.** Contact the 9 testers who rated BallotBox 7 or lower, to confirm whether the
  changes above resolve what they ran into.

## Feedback Loop

```text
Test → Collect feedback → Identify themes → Prioritize → Implement → Document → Continue testing
```

1. **Test.** Testers use the live app on Midnight Preprod.
2. **Collect feedback.** Wallet address, rating and written review, sent through the in-app
   Feedback button or the GitHub issue form.
3. **Identify themes.** Each review is tagged with an area (`onboarding`, `wallet`,
   `proving`, `voting-ux`, `organizer`, `docs`, `privacy` or `bug`) and grouped into themes.
   A theme's reach is the number of distinct testers who raised it.
4. **Prioritize.** Themes are scored and handled from the top down:

   **Priority = Impact × Reach ÷ Effort**

   | Score | Impact | Reach | Effort |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 3 | Blocks voting | ≥ 25% of respondents | ≤ ½ day |
   | 2 | Causes drop-off or confusion | 10–25% | ≤ 2 days |
   | 1 | Nice to have | < 10% | > 2 days |

   Privacy and security issues always go first. Blockers in the core voting journey come
   before lower-impact requests. Contract changes are batched, because each one needs a
   redeploy.
5. **Implement.** One PR per theme, with docs updated in the same PR.
6. **Document.** The change and its commit are recorded here and in `CHANGELOG.md`.
7. **Continue testing.** Re-test on Preprod and compare the ratings and themes with this
   cohort.

## Privacy & Safety

BallotBox feedback collection must never request:

- seed phrases
- private keys
- wallet passwords
- private witnesses
- confidential ballot information

Only public wallet addresses and ordinary product feedback are collected.

## Final Summary

71 testers rated BallotBox **8.9 / 10** on average (median **9 / 10**), and 62 of them gave
it 8 or higher. The most common praise was for the private voting experience itself: clear,
simple, and private without extra complexity. The most common requests were about the first
run: onboarding, wallet setup and transaction status. That is where the iteration work has
gone, and where the next round of testing will focus.
